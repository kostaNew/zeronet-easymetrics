# zeronet-easymetrics
New ZeroNet plugin, which write stats information from node by time.

Instruction:
 - Copy EasyMetrics folder to ZeroNet/plugins/ folder
 - Restart ZeroNet
 - Look in ZeroNet/metrics/site
 - Use numpy+matplotlib and data templates from EasyMetricsConfig for data threatment

It's very early alpha, which demonstrate the idea. I suppose, the plugin may be usefull for developer, community leader, proxies admin, data scientist and sociologiest. 

I am waiting you feedback in issues.
